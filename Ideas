//to add a start button to the code. then turn on led light on untill next loop.

// we need move tins/bottles at the start of the loop just incase its the first run.
// code needs reset all air rams to default, this realy should happen every time it start / or switched on. might need you help here Kloon.

// withdrawing the fillers from the cans will reduce the contents slightly, uk regs being what they are we may need to backfill following 
// the retraction of the fillers it might be preferable if this is done before they are fully retracted. if this could be timed to happen
// just as the before the fillers get above the liquid this would reduce splashing and any possible contamination. 

// if we set the sensors a little higher to make up for the drop, could this work?
// -Probably depends on the volume of the steel below the top of the fluid (thickness of the pipe walls etc) may not be an issue but the
// cans I've looked at tonight have very little unfilled space. Its just really something to keep in mind. The beer still in the pipe may
// be enough todo it as it drops out on the raise. 

// Just noticed this file..  I guess this is where we keep track of ideas/suggestions.  I created an "Issue" earlier for a 
// "all stop" feature.  The idea is that you should be able stop the machine at any time.  Example...  what if you're filling
// and you spring a leak or something..  Or some how a can is not aligned properly and causes a jam etc... etc...
