// we need move tins/bottles at the start of the loop just incase its the first run.

// withdrawing the fillers from the cans will reduce the contents slightly, uk regs being what they are we may need to backfill following 
// the retraction of the fillers it might be preferable if this is done before they are fully retracted. if this could be timed to happen
// just as the before the fillers get above the liquid this would reduce splashing and any possible contamination. 

// if we set the sensors a little higher to make up for the drop, could this work?
// -Probably depends on the volume of the steel below the top of the fluid (thickness of the pipe walls etc) may not be an issue but the
// cans I've looked at tonight have very little unfilled space. Its just really something to keep in mind. The beer still in the pipe may
// be enough todo it as it drops out on the raise.
