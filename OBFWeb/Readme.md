This code is initially designed to run on an NodeMCU
acting as a Serial to Wifi bridge to allow the current version of code to run on an Arduino UNO
and have the option of attaching a second controller that will deal with all the Web Config activities

NodeMCU is not capable of running the 3 Analogue pins required by the code at this time.
